The Great Iceflow Relay

Hi yall,

This is a little relay ball game addon for Turtle WoW, played on Iceflow Lake in Dun Morogh.
It’s a simple but fun RP activity where you and your friends run through checkpoints, pass the ball around, and try to score the most Iceflow Shards while avoiding penalties.

I made this addon because I love throwing the ball in WoW, but just passing it back and forth got a little stale. So I thought, why not turn it into a proper mini-game? I’m new to addon development and not much of a coder, so I used AI help to put this together. It’s pretty simple, mostly chat commands, but I think it adds a cute bit of gameplay for anyone who enjoys RP events and silly fun with the ball.

🏁 How the game works

There are 6 checkpoints: one Start, four in between, and one Finish.

The race begins at the landing stage in Brewnall Village.

To prepare, you can:

Type /iceflow checkpoints → see coordinates of all checkpoints.

Move to a spot and type /iceflow check → see if you are standing inside a checkpoint.

🎮 Commands

/iceflow ready → Arms the addon and signals the group that you’re ready.

Enter the Start checkpoint → Relay begins and everyone gets a group message.

/iceflow end → Disarms the addon.

/iceflow pos → Prints your current coordinates.

/iceflow ballcheck → Tells you if you have a leather ball in your bags.

💎 Scoring

Players earn Iceflow Shards when:

Catching the ball.

Entering a checkpoint.

Players get penalties for:

Holding the ball too long.

Standing too close to another player (must stay at least 28 yards apart).

At the Finish checkpoint, the addon posts a summary to the group chat:

Total Shards earned.

Total Penalty collected.

Net Shards (your final score).

👥 Group Play

Designed mainly for pairs, but works fine with more players too.

Example: three players can run in a triangle, passing two or even three balls around at once.

Works in both party and raid groups.

🗺️ Route

The checkpoints can be tricky to find, so here’s a marked map of the course:

✨ Closing words

This addon is meant as a light RP mini-game for Turtle WoW. It’s not super polished, but it’s fun if you like silly challenges with friends.

Wishing yall lots of joy and many Iceflow Shards in Azeroth!
